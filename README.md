# Wastetastic

A seamless cross platform mobile application built using Flutter for managing one’s waste disposal strategies.

## Getting Started

With a 7-fold increase in the amount of solid waste disposed of, responsible waste disposal has become an issue of primary importance. As residents of Singapore, it is our prime duty to ensure that we do our part in contributing to this noble cause. Our Wastetastic App aims to provide an integrated platform for managing one’s waste, while providing a seamless experience. This App is designed to be intuitive and user friendly.

## Purpose of the project

Wastetastic is an Android and iOS mobile app which allows users across Singapore to view waste disposal vendors/recycling points of 5 different categories: Normal Waste, E-Waste, Lighting Waste, Waste Treatment (Industrial Waste) and Cash for Trash. Its purpose, under the Smart Nation Singapore program, is to incentivize users to dispose off waste responsibly, in times when the environment is in dire need of our help. This document outlines the plan involved in the software development of the Wastetastic App. The intended readers of this document are current and future developers of Wastetastic.

## Project Scope

Wastetastic serves as a guide for users on waste disposal and recycling points (Waste POIs) all across Singapore. It provides information about these various waste POIs in the form of description, address, location, working hours, etc. It further also allows users to check the real time parking availability near a Waste POI, should the user be planning to dispose of his waste immediately. Finally, it also gives users general guidelines on how to recycle and allows users to keep track of the personal waste that they dispose off.
